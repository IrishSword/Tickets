Welcome.

You will need to do the following.

Install WAMP - go tot www.wamp.com
Download this code into your\wamp\www\tickets folder (starting in \wamp\www is probably right)
Run the database creation .sql file, currently tickets\install\gencon_2011.sql
 do that in myphpadmin in the interface. It will create the database, the table and insert the 2011 data.

good luck.

please post thank yous, bug reports and feature requests on github.  However that works.

Mike.
